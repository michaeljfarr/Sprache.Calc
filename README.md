Sprache.LogicCalc
============


This library provides expression evaluator based on [Sprache Calc](https://github.com/yallie/Sprache.Calc) that 
provides the calculation functions:

* arithmetic operations with basic math functions
  * (5 + 6) ^ 5 * SIN(y/x)
* logic operations  
  * ((x + 6) > (y *4)) && ('false' == z)
* custom functions variables and constants
  * GetLength('GH323') * (x + :y)
* variables and constants
  * (x + :y)
